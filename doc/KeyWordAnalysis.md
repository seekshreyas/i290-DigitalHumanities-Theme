## Ch4 : Keywords of Individual Texts
Pg : _55_

### Objectives in the Chapter: 
- method of identifying KeyWords (KW) in text
	- identify items of unusual frequency in comparison with a reference corpus
- 2 kinds of outputs in a key words list:
	- __aboutness indicators__
	- __stylistic indicators__
- demonstrate how a plot of keywords can illustrate themes and progressions of text. 


#### Keyness
_Keyness_ is a quality words may have in a given text or set of texts, suggesting that they are important, they reflect what the text is really about, avoiding trivia and insignificant detail.


To establish term _keyness_ there are 2 methods:

1. Kintsch & van Dijk's (1978)
	- propositional analysis of text identifies text structure, establishing a hierarchy which we might label heirarchy of keyness
2. Hoey (2001)
	- analyze sentences
3. Author's process

##### Method 1 (Kintsch & van Dijk):
Consider, sample text:
	
	EastEnders star Steve McFadden was 'stable' in St. Thomas's Hospital, London, 
	last night after being stabbed in the back, arm and hand under Waterloo Bridge, 
	Central London, on Friday. 

Propositional analysis will give us:

	1. S. McF is a star
	2. S. McF is in EastEnders
	3. S.McF was stable
	4. someone said that
	5. S.McF is in hospital
	6. The hospital is called St. Thomas's
	7. The hospital is in London
	8. was so last night

Then figure out which proposition is referred to most in the entire set ( __macropropositions__ ). The propositions then naturally fall into a hierarchy of prominence, reflecting their __keyness__. The propositions, more than others, are what the text is really ' __about__ '.


##### Method 2 (Hoey):

###### Step 1
This method takes __sentences__ and not propositions. It seeks out elements which are most linked. A __link__ is a _repetition of some kind_ like 
- __Grammatical variants__ ( _want - wanted_ )
- __Synonyms__ ( _desire_ , etc)
- __Hyponyms__
- __Meronyms__
- __Antonyms__ 
- __Equivalents__ (like McFadden referred as _he, McFadden, star, actor_)
of a word being considered would count as repetitions making for _links_. 

###### Step 2
Links alone do not suffice, what makes a sentence truly prominent is when it is __bonded__ by a _pattern of at least 3 links with other sentences in the text_


Both these methods rely on __conceptual repetition__ to come up with __keyness__. 


##### Method 3 (Author's process):
###### Step 1:
Verbatim repetition of words (so _wanted, want, wants_ are same)

###### Step 2:
Use a __reference corpus__ (preferrably large) to generate an __expected__ frequency of those words

Then find out those words which occur _outstandingly more_ than their expected values based on the reference corpus. These are the __keywords__ (KW)

To find out whether a word is _outstanding_ do a chi-square analysis (observed vs expected)

###### Sample results:

### Links between KW
Consider linkage betweek KWs as __collocational neighbours__. This will give KeyWords which not only share _textual keyness_ but _local proximity_ as well like say having a range of _x_ words left or right of the keyword is the collaction neighbourhood.

It should be noted that KW linkages are not, like ordinary collocational linkages, since they require both node and collocate to be __key__ (general collocate just returns values like _strong tea_ which just classifies the tea. But by looking for keywords in a range of say 5 words left or right of the key, collocate establishes a relation between 2 different key concepts)



## Ch5 : Keywords and genres
Pg : _73_

### Objectives in the Chapter: 
- explain notion of __association__ i.e. the contextual relationship between words that are key in the same texts. 

### Keyword linkage between texts
We have established __keyness__ and __co-keyness__. 

#### Jones's (1971) patterns in keyword linkage
<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2670838/Markdown/img/i290dh_kw_linkage.png" width="500" alt="keyword links in text" />

- __Strings__ occur when a series of KWs are connected one to the next within a text
- __Star__ linkage occcur when a central KW is shared in linkage by several texts
- __Clique__ has a set of inter-connected KWs
- __Clumps__ are also inter-connected but have links to other parts of the text as well (represented with dashed lines)

Keywords across texts can be plotted as a graph.
